Hello!

Welcome to my Productive Plant Project.

I have created my Database using PostgreSQL. 

My Model classes, that are seperated - Entity class, Controller class, Service class, Repository class and Configuration class.

This is also a Spring boot RESTful application - IDE is IntelliJ. 

Why?

This project aims to help productiveness throughout your daily life. 
Instead of planning way ahead and forgetting about what is in front of you, I am looking to build Productive Plant to help be productive in the moment. 
Therefore, making sure to be productive today to lessen the load for tomorrow! No matter the size of the objective, longest it's an objective, it is better than nothing. 
The plant represents your workload or really much your stress level... As long as you keep the health 100% you are finishing your objectives, which can help to reduce stress, anxiety and ect. 
This has the potential to become something great, as well as treated as a 'break' from focusing too much, that you get to reflect on what you have achieved, rather than just focusing on what you have left to do. 

MVP:

User starts of with a plant.
The plant has full health and an option to be named anything the user wants it to be. 
User has to set a minimum of 3 objectives/goals. 
As User completes an objective, they can water the plant.
If the User has any objectives left over by the end of the day, the amount of objectives left over determines the amount of damage to the plant. 

Bonus:

Can add timed objectives, an objective to complete in the Morning, Afternoon and Night. 
If missed, then this can cause damage to the plant. 
Include health regen, so if the User completes all their objectives by the end of each day, the plant recieves health.
